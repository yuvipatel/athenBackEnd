"GSE45027","The transcriptional response of Cryptococcus neoformans to ingestion by Acanthamoeba castellanii and murine macrophages","12","Virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans for mammals was proposed to emerge from evolutionary pressures on its natural environment by protozoan predators, which selected for strategies that allow survival within macrophages. In fact, Acanthamoeba castellanii ingests yeast cells, which then replicate intracellularly. In addition, most fungal factors needed to establish infection in the mammalian host are also important for survival within the amoeba. To better understand the origin of C. neoformans virulence, we compared the transcriptional profile of yeast cells internalized by amoebae and murine macrophages after 6 h of infection. Our results showed 656 and 293 genes whose expression changed at least two-fold in response to the intracellular environments of amoebae and macrophages, respectively. Among the genes common to both groups, we focused on the ORF CNAG_05662, which was potentially related to sugar transport. We constructed a mutant strain and evaluated its ability to grow on various carbon sources. The results showed that this gene, named PTP1 (Polyol Transporter Protein 1), is involved in the transport of 5- and 6-carbon polyols but its absence had no effect on virulence. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mammalian virulence originated from fungal-protozoal interactions and provide a better understanding of how C. neoformans adapts to the mammalian host.","2013/03/14"
"GSE27232","Strand specific sequencing illustrates the complex transcriptional response of Legionella pneumophila during infection","5","Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular human pathogen with a distinct biphasic lifestyle. One of its primary environmental hosts in the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and its infection by L. pneumophila mimics that seen in human macrophages. Here we present analysis of strand specific sequencing of the transcriptional response of L. pneumophila in broth growth and in infection of A. castellanii.","2011/02/11"
