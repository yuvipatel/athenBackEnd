"GSE68059","Regulatory (pan-)genome of an obligate intracellular pathogen in the PVC superphylum","10","Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms take deterministic decisions to reprogram cell fates. A macroscopic manifestation of such an event is the remodelling of the cells’ morphology and it typically is governed at the molecular scale by massive reorganization of the cellular transcriptome. With the regulation at the level of transcription initiation representing the most common form for such developmental reprogramming, cells typically rely on one or several master regulators to coordinate the the activity of hundreds of genes simultaneously by directly binding to their promoters. Despite the apparent simplicity of prokaryotes and their reduced genome size compared to that of their eukaryotic counterparts, free-living bacteria typically encode hundreds of transcription factors (TFs) in their genomes that could act as master TFs. By contrast, obligate intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydiae have a drastically reduced genome due to their intimate association with the host and thus a smaller number of TF genes. The genomes of members of the Chlamydiaceae family, which include the well-known bacterial pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae, are only 1-1.2 Mbp. By contrast, members of the environmental Chlamydiae Waddlia chondrophila and Parachlamydia acanthamoebae have a 2-fold and 3-fold larger genome, respectively, likely allowing for an expansion of the host range while still retaining their host dependence and parasitic life style. Moreover, they all exhibit a characteristic chlamydial developmental cycle via two functionally specialized morphotypes, the infectious non-dividing elementary bodies (EBs) and the non-infectious dividing reticulate bodies (RBs). This developmental cycle is usually divided in three stages: the early stage during which EBs enter host cells and differentiate into RBs; the mid-stage where RBs proliferate inside a vacuole called inclusion and the late stage where RBs differentiate back into EBs and are released after exocytosis or cell lysis. Chlamydial genes are thus classified into three different temporal classes (early, mid and late expressed genes), likely reflecting the need of these transcripts in each of the three developmental stages. W. chondrophila, an emerging pathogen implicated in abortion in bovine and miscarriage in humans, encodes less than 20 TFs, 10 of which are conserved among the Chlamydiae. In light of this low TF multiplicity in the chlamydial pan-genome along with the common developmental cycle and parasitic life style, we aimed to define the regulatory pan-genome of each these conserved TFs to identify the elusive chlamydial master regulator and to characterize underling specificity for its target promoters using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by deep-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of chlamydial cells growing inside the host. The immunochemistry of ChIP-Seq has the advantage of minimizing the contaminating nucleic acids compared to chlamydial transcriptome studies, it has the added benefit of providing the first unambiguous glimpse into the regulatory landscape of a bacterium inside host, offering a solid framework in understanding the stochastic and/or deterministic switches that bacteria rely on during infections.","2016/02/19"
"GSE27232","Strand specific sequencing illustrates the complex transcriptional response of Legionella pneumophila during infection","5","Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular human pathogen with a distinct biphasic lifestyle. One of its primary environmental hosts in the free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and its infection by L. pneumophila mimics that seen in human macrophages. Here we present analysis of strand specific sequencing of the transcriptional response of L. pneumophila in broth growth and in infection of A. castellanii.","2011/02/11"
"GSE23032","Comparison of SCOTS and standard microarray protocol","12","Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, an acute pulmonary infection. L. pneumophila is able to infect and multiply in both phagocytic protozoan, such as Acanthamoeba castellanii, and mammalian professional phagocytes. The best-known virulence determinant used by L. pneumophila to infect host cells is a Type IVb translocation system named Icm/Dot, which is used to modify the host cell functions to the benefit of the bacteria. To date the Icm/Dot systeme is known to translocate more than 100 effectors. While the transcriptional response of Legionella to the intracellular environement of A. castelannii as already been investigated, much less is known of how Legionella reacts transcriptionnally inside human macrophages. In this study, the transcriptome of L. pneumophila was monitored during exponential and post-exponential phase in rich AYE broth and during infection of human cultured macrophages by using microarray and a RNA amplification procedure called SCOTS to allow for the study of conditions of low bacterial loads. Among the genes induced intracellularly are those involved in amino acid synthesis pathway leading to L-arginine, L-histidne and L-proline as well as many transport system involved in amino acid and iron uptake. The Icm/Dot systems is not differentially expressed inside cells compare to the E phase control but the effectors are strongly induced. The intracellular transcriptome was further used to identify putative new Icm/Dot effectors and translocation was show to occur for 3 of them. This study provides a comprehensive view of how L. pneumophila react to the human macrophages intracellular environment.","2011/01/01"
