"GSE54012","Amoebal endosymbiont Neochlamydia S13 gene expression in host amoebae when Leginella infected","2","To further development of our gene expression approch to intracellular pathogenic bacterial controlling, we have employed castamized Neochlamydia S13 genomic microarray as a discovery platform to identy genes with the potential to inhibit Legionella growth into hoat amoebae , based on our data that the the amoebae haboring amoebal endosymbiont Neochlamydia S13 (an environmental chlamydia) could evade Legionella infection.","2014/12/31"
