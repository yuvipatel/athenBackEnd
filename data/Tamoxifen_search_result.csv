Tamoxifen,GSE77496,Microarray expression profiling data for Trp53-null mammary epithelial cells and tumors from a mouse model with a K8+ luminal cell origin,"Mammary epithelium is hierarchically organized, with multipotent basal mammary stem cells (MaSCs) producing both luminal and basal cells during development or upon transplantation. Recent studies suggested that most breast cancers might originate from luminal cells, and oncogenic events, such as ectopic expression of PIK3CAH1047R, could induce multipotency in committed luminal cells. p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human breast cancer; in particular, its inactivating mutations are found in most triple-negative breast cancers, raising a question as to whether p53-loss plays a key role in acquisition of MaSC-like properties by luminal cells. By in situ lineage tracing, we found that induced loss of p53 in Keratin 8 (K8)+ luminal cells led to their clonal expansion, in part due to increased proliferation, but did not directly affect their luminal identity. Expansion of luminal cells, in particular oestrogen receptor-positive luminal cells, was observed 3-4 weeks after induced p53-loss, which was accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle genes and downregulation of genes related to immune microenvironment, p53 downstream pathway and apoptosis control. All induced mice eventually developed mammary tumours with 9qA1 (Yap1) amplification and/or 6qA2 (Met) amplification. The resulting tumours exhibited a MaSC-like expression signature and most closely resembled Claudin-Low breast cancer. Overall, these data suggest that although p53 does not directly control the luminal fate, its loss facilitates acquisition of MaSC-like properties by luminal cells and predisposes them to development of mammary tumours with loss of luminal identity. Our data also suggest that Claudin-Low breast cancer can originate from luminal cells, possibly upon transition through a basal-like state.","Total RNAs from YFP+ mammary epithelial cells sorted from K8-CreER;Trp53L/L;Rosa26-Stop-YFP or K8-CreER;Rosa26-Stop-YFP females 4 weeks after tamoxifen induction, or from mammary tumors developed in Trp53L/L females or K8-CreER;Trp53L/L females 6-7 months after intraductal injection of Ad-K8-Cre adenovirus or tamoxifen induction, respectively, were prepared and subjected to microarray expression profiling.",GPL16570,16,Expression profiling by array,NA
Tamoxifen,GSE80354,Gata6 promotes hair follicle matrix progenitor cell renewal by genome maintenance via Edaradd/NF-<U+03BA>B,"Cell proliferation is essential to rapid tissue growth and repair, but is inherently associated with considerable genome damage that cells must efficiently prevent or fix to prevent cell cycle arrest. Here, we implicate the transcription factor Gata6 in regulation of adult mouse hair follicle regeneration where it controls the renewal of the rapidly proliferating epithelial (matrix) progenitors and hence the extent of production of terminally differentiated lineages. We find that Gata6 protects against DNA damage associated with proliferation, thus preventing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Gata6 stimulates the Eddarad/NF-kB pathway, important for DNA-damage repair and stress response in general, and for hair follicle growth in particular. Finally, we find Edaradd essential, downstream of Gata6 for cell survival and proliferation. Our data add to recent evidence in embryonic stem and neural progenitor cells, suggesting a model whereby developmentally regulated transcription factors protect from DNA damage associated with proliferation occurring at key stages of rapid tissue growth. Our data may aid in understanding why Gata6 is a frequent target of amplification in cancers.",Gene expression profiling by mRNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in wild type (WT) and Gata6 induced knockout (iKO) mouse epidermal keratinocytes,"GPL13112, GPL19057",6,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,27908934

Tamoxifen,GSE78045,p53 is a critical regulator of airway epithelial progenitor cell homeostasis.,"How progenitor cells regulate quiescence and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates both proliferation and differentiation of club progenitor cells in the airway epithelium. We show that p53 loss decreases ciliated cell differentiation and increases the proliferative capacity of club progenitors, increasing epithelial cell density. p53 deficient progenitors generated a pseudostratified epithelium containing basal-like cells in vitro and contained an increased proportion of BASCs in vivo, suggesting that p53 suppresses multipotency during homeostasis. Conversely, an additional copy of p53 decreases proliferation and increases ciliated cell differentiation. Using single cell RNA-Seq, we expose heterogeneity within airway epithelial progenitor cells and found that cell cycle regulators, particularly p21, are altered following p53 loss. Together, these findings reveal an essential role for p53 in regulating progenitor cell behavior, which has broad implications in understanding both stem cell and cancer biology",Examination of progenitor cell behavior in p53 knock out and wild type,GPL19057,150,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,NA

Tamoxifen,GSE77867,Combined blockade of MET and EGFR abolishes liver regeneration,"Receptor tyrosine kinases MET and EGFR are critically involved in initiation of liver regeneration. Other cytokines and signaling molecules also help in the early part of the process.  Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for missing signals. Elimination of any single signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling abolishes liver regeneration, prevents restoration of liver mass and leads to liver decompensation. Our results demonstrate that liver function is dependent on synchronous availability of signaling from these two pathways. The study shows that MET and EGFR separately control many non-overlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked. The combined elimination of the signals however was not tolerated. The results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and liver decompensation.;We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in METKO-canertinib mouse liver  following a partial hepatectomy",Systemic inhibition MET-EGFR signaling pathway in mice liver regeneration in mice was carried out by using a tamoxifen inducible system EGFR was inhibited by using Canertinib added to diet.

Tamoxifen,GSE62613,Nuclear TIGAR mediates an epigenetic-metabolic loop via Nrf2 for cancer therapeutics resistance,"Epigenetic and metabolic reprogrammings are implicated in cancer progression with unclear mechanisms. We report here that the histone methyltransferase NSD2 drives cancer cell and tumor resistance to therapeutics such as tamoxifen, doxorubicin, and radiation by reprogramming of glucose metabolism. NSD2 coordinately up-regulates expression of TIGAR, HK2 and G6PD and stimulates pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) production of NADPH for ROS reduction. We discover that elevated expression of TIGAR, previously characterized as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, is localized in the nuclei of resistant tumor cells where it stimulates NSD2 expression and global H3K36me2 mark. Mechanistically, TIGAR interacts with the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 and facilitates chromatin assembly of Nrf2-H3K4me3 methylase MLL1 and elongating Pol-II, independent of its metabolic enzymatic activity. In human tumors, high levels of NSD2 correlate strongly with early recurrence and poor survival and are associated with nuclear-localized TIGAR. This study defines a nuclear TIGAR-mediated, epigenetic autoregulatory loop functioning in redox rebalance for resistance to tumor therapeutics.","A total of 4 samples were analyzed in this study.

Tamoxifen,GSE81162,EPRS is a Critical Regulator of Cell Proliferation and Estrogen Signaling in ER+ Breast Cancer,"Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are a class of enzymes with well-conserved housekeeping functions in cellular translation.  Recent evidence suggests that ARS genes may participate in a wide array of cellular processes, and may contribute to the pathology of autoimmune disease, cancer, and other diseases.  Several studies have suggested a role for the glutamyl prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in breast cancers, although none has demonstrated any underlying mechanism about how EPRS contributes to carcinogenesis.  In this study, we identified EPRS as upregulated in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) human breast tumors in the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts, with copy number gains in nearly 50% of samples in both datasets.  EPRS expression is associated with reduced overall survival in patients with ER+ tumors in TCGA and METABRIC datasets.  EPRS expression was also associated with reduced distant relapse-free survival in patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy for five years, and EPRS-correlated genes were highly enriched for genes predictive of a poor response to tamoxifen.  We demonstrated the necessity of EPRS for proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant ER+ breast cancer, but not ER- breast cancer cells.  Transcriptomic profiling showed that EPRS regulated cell cycle and estrogen response genes.  Finally, we constructed a causal gene network based on over 2500 ER+ breast tumor samples to build up an EPRS-estrogen signaling pathway.

Tamoxifen,GSE80085,Oviductal vs. ovarian epithelial transformation yields very different tumor phenotypes in Apc fl/fl;Pten fl/fl mice,"We treated 6-8 week old mice that had floxed alleles of both Apc and Pten (for both alleles in each case) that also carry an Ovgp1-iCre-ERT2 transgene, with one of two treatments; a third group received neither treatment. The Ovgp1-iCre-ERT2 expresses Cre recombinase fused to a tamoxifen-inducible fragment of the estrogen receptor, in tissues where the Ovgp1 gene (oviductal glycoprotein 1) is expressed, which is almost exclusively in mouse oviductal epithelium (equivalent to human fallopian tube epithelium = FTE). Treating the mice with tamoxifen permits the Cre recombinase to enter the cell nucleus and inactivate the Apc and Pten genes. Six of the mice were treated with intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (0.1g/kg of body weight) dissolved in corn oil on days 1 and 3 and developed oviductal tumors (OdT) yielding 6 of the samples. Four mice (yielding 5 samples) were instead injected with 50 million plaque-forming units of replication-incompetent AdCre into both ovarian bursal cavities on day 1, which inactivated Apc and Pten in the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), and lead to ovarian tumors (OT). Ovaries were also harvested from four untreated 6-8 week old mice with the same genotype, with two ovaries from each mouse comprising one control sample. RNA was purified from tumor or normal tissue, and targets for Affymetrix arrays synthesized from the mRNAs.  We used Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST arrays, which hold 41345 probe-sets, but we largely analyzed just those 25216 probe-sets that were mapped to Entrez gene IDs.  Raw data was processed with Robust Multi-array Average algorithm (RMA).  Data is log2-transformed transcript abundance estimates. We fit a one-way ANOVA model to the three groups of samples.  We supply a supplementary excel workbook that holds the same data as the data matrix file, but also holds the probe-set annotation at the time we analyzed the data, and some simple statistical calculations, which select subsets of the probe-sets as differentially expressed.  Consumers should consider obtaining more up-to-date probe-set annotation for the array platform. We also provide supplementary excel files that show our simple analysis of GSE6008, which consists of 99 human ovarian tumor samples of 4 types, and 4 normal ovary samples, where we fit an ANOVA model to the 5 groups. In yet another supplementary file we show the correlation between each human tumor and mouse tumor, where we correlate the difference in log2-transformed values of each tumor from the average of the normals for the same species, for just those genes that were 1-to-1 best homologs according to build 68 of NCBI's Homologene, in order to see how much the human tumors resemble the mouse tumors.","Six oviductal tumor samples from 6 mice with conditional knockout of Apc and Pten driven by an Ovgp1-iCre-ERT2 transgene , 5 ovarian tumor samples from 4 mice with conditional knockout of Apc and Pten driven by injection of AdCre into both ovarian bursal cavities, and 4 normal ovary samples from 4 mice.",GPL17400,15,Expression profiling by array,27538791
Tamoxifen,GSE72190,ZIP7 is indispensable for proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and maintenance of intestinal stem cells,"Intestinal epithelium are generated by intestinal stem cells, which are recognized morphologically as slender columnar cells at the base of the crypt. Stem cells produce transit-amplifying (TA) cells, which divide a number of times and the daughter cells differentiate into absorptive enterocytes as well as secretory-lineages. Intestinal stem cells highly express Lgr5 which is decreased in TA cells. Here, we show that the zinc transported SLC39A7/ZIP7 is essential for the proliferation of TA cells and maintenance of intestinal stem cells. Lgr5Med TA cells derived from Zip7-deficient mice upregulated the expression of unfold protein responses-related genes including pro-apoptotic genes, indicating of induction of ER stress in these cells. The same effect was seen in Lgr5Hi stem cells derived from Zip7-deficient mice. We conclude that ZIP7 is fundamental to the maintenance of crypt homeostasis by resolving ER stress.","Small intestinal crypts were isolated form tamoxifen-treated control (Zip7flox/+, Villin-CreERT2, Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2) and tamoxifen-treated Zip7<U+2206>IEC (Zip7flox/flox, Villin-CreERT2, Lgr5-EGFP-ires-CreERT2) mice.

Tamoxifen,GSE68090,Expression analysis of a preinvasive pancreatic cancer mouse model with and without p120 catenin,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers with a 5 year survival rate of about 5%.  Therapeutic options are limited, especially for patients that present with late state disease and metastasis.  Although the metastatic burden of pancreatic cancer is usually high, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate delamination and dissemination of epithelial cells from preinvasive and malignant pancreatic lesions.  Here, we used a preinvasive mouse model of pancreatic cancer to conditionally knockout p120 catenin (Ctnnd1).  Mice with biallelic loss of p120 catenin progressively develop high grade PanIN lesions and neoplasia accompanied by prominent acute and chronic inflammatory processes.  Loss of p120 catenin in the context of oncogenic Kras also promotes remarkable apical and basal epithelial cell extrusion.  Abundant single epithelial cells exit PanIN epithelium basally, survive, and display features of malignancy.  Similar extrusion defects are observed following p120 catenin knockdown in vitro, and these effects are completely abrogated by activation of S1P/S1P2 signaling.  Our results establish p120 catenin and S1P/S1P2 signaling as novel regulators of non-EMT mediated epithelial cell invasion in pancreatic neoplasia.","Transcriptomes of KCiMist1G; p120wt/wt and KCiMist1G; p120f/f pancreases were compared, with three replicates each, using microarray.",GPL6096,6,Expression profiling by array,27032419

Tamoxifen,GSE84206,Deregulation of the pRb-E2F4 axis alters epidermal homeostasis and favors tumor development,"E2F/RB activity is altered in most human tumors. The retinoblastoma family of proteins plays a key role in regulating the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 to S phases. This is achieved through negative regulation of E2F transcription factors, important positive regulators of cell cycle entry. E2F family members are divided in two groups: activators (E2F1-E2F3a) and repressors (E2F3b-E2F8). E2F4 accounts for a large part of the E2F activity and is a main E2F repressor member in vivo. Perturbations in the balance from quiescence towards proliferation contribute to increased mitotic gene expression levels frequently observed in cancer. We have previously reported that combined Rb1-Rbl1 and Rb1-E2F1 ablation in epidermis produces important alterations in epidermal proliferation and differentiation, leading to tumor development. However, the possible roles of E2F4 in this context are still to be determined. Here we show the absence of any discernible phenotype in the skin of mice lacking of E2F4. In contrast, the inducible loss of Rb1 in the epidermis of E2F4-null mice produced multiple skin abnormalities including altered differentiation and proliferation, spontaneous wounds, carcinoma in situ development and stem cell perturbations. All these phenotypic alterations are associated with extensive gene expression changes, the induction of c-myc and the Akt activation. Moreover, the whole transcriptome analyses in comparison with previous models generated also revealed extensive changes in multiple repressive complexes and in transcription factor activity. These results point to E2F4 as a master regulator in multiple steps of epidermal homeostasis in Rb1 absence.","Gene expression was compared between skin from transgenic Rbf/f;K14creERTM, Rbf/f;K14creERTM;E2F1-/-, Rbf/f;K14creERTM;E2F4-/- and Rbf/f, E2F4-/- mice.

Tamoxifen,GSE81177,Gene expression analysis to identify Runx1 target genes in GMP,"Disrupting mutations of the RUNX1 gene are found in 10% of patients with myelodysplasia (MDS) and 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous studies have revealed an increase in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells in conditional Runx1-knockout (KO) mice, but the molecular mechanism is unresolved. We investigated the myeloid progenitor (MP) compartment in KO mice, arguing that disruptions at the HSC/MPP level may be amplified in downstream cells. We demonstrate that the MP compartment is increased more than fivefold in Runx1 KO mice, with a prominent skewing toward megakaryocyte (Meg) progenitors. Runx1- deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are characterized by increased cloning capacity, impaired development into mature cells, and HSC and Meg transcription signatures. An HSC/MPP subpopulation expressing Meg markers was also increased in Runx1-deficient mice. Rescue experiments coupled with transcriptome analysis and Runx1 DNA-binding assays demonstrated that commitment is marked by Runx1 suppression of genes encoding adherence and motility proteins (Tek, Jam3, Plxnc1, Pcdh7, and Selp) that support HSC–Meg interactions with the BM niche. In vitro assays confirmed that enforced Tek expression in HSCs/MPPs increases Meg output. Interestingly, besides this key repressor function of Runx1 to control lineage decisions and cell numbers in progenitors, our study also revealed a critical activating function in erythroblast differentiation, in addition to its known importance in Meg and granulocyte/monocyte (G/M) maturation. Thus both repressor and activator functions of Runx1 at multiple hematopoietic stages and lineages likely contribute to the tumor suppressor activity in MDS and AML.",GMP were isolated either from Runx1+/+-Tg(vav-Cre) and Runx1fl/fl-Tg(vav-Cre) mice or from mice transplanted with Runx1fl/fl-Tg(vav-Cre) progenitors engineered to express GFP with RUNX1-ERt2 or ERt2.

Two-condition experiment, Control DCs vs. G2 Knockout DCs. Biological replicates: 4 control, 3 Gata2 knockout, independently grown and harvested. One replicate per array.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical immune response regulators; however, the mechanism of DC differentiation is not fully understood. Heterozygous germline GATA2 mutations induce GATA2 deficiency syndrome, characterized by monocytopenia, a predisposition to myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia, and a profoundly reduced DC population, which is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections, impaired phagocytosis, and decreased cytokine production. To define the role of GATA2 in DC differentiation and function, we studied Gata2 conditional knockout and haploinsufficient mice. Gata2 conditional deficiency significantly reduced the DC count, whereas Gata2 haploinsufficiency did not affect this population. GATA2 was required for the in vitro generation of DCs from Lin-Sca-1+Kit+ cells, common myeloid-restricted progenitors, and common dendritic cell precursors, but not common lymphoid-restricted progenitors or granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, suggesting that GATA2 functions in the myeloid pathway of DC differentiation. Moreover, expression profiling demonstrated reduced expression of myeloid-related genes, including mafb, and increased expression of T-lymphocyte-related genes, including Gata3 and Tcf7, in Gata2-deficient DC progenitors. In addition, GATA2 was found to bind an enhancer element 190-kb downstream region of Gata3, and a reporter assay exhibited significantly reduced luciferase activity after adding this enhancer region to the Gata3 promoter, which was recovered by GATA sequence deletion within Gata3 +190.

Tamoxifen,GSE79292,Regulation of normal B cell differentiation and malignant B cell survival by OCT2 (expression),"The requirement for the B cell transcription factor OCT2 (encoded by Pou2f2) in germinal center B cells has proved controversial. Here, we report that germinal center B cells are formed normally after depletion of OCT2 in a conditional knockout mouse but that their proliferation is reduced and in vivo differentiation to antibody-secreting plasma cells is blocked. This led us to examine the role of OCT2 in germinal center derived lymphomas. ShRNA knockdown showed that almost all DLBCL cell lines are addicted to the expression of OCT2 and its co-activator OCA-B. Genome-wide chromatin Immunoprecipitation analysis and gene expression profiling revealed the broad transcriptional program regulated by OCT2 that includes the expression of STAT3, IL10, ELL2, XBP1, MYC, TERT and ADA. Importantly, genetic alteration of OCT2 is not a requirement for cellular addiction in DLBCL. However, we detected amplifications of the POU2F2 locus in DLBCL tumor biopsies as well as a recurrent mutation of threonine 223 in the DNA binding domain of OCT2. This neomorphic mutation subtly alters the DNA binding preference of OCT2 leading to the transactivation of novel target genes including HIF1a and FCRL3. Finally, by introducing mutations designed to disrupt the OCT2-OCA-B interface we reveal a requirement for this protein-protein interface that might ultimately be exploited therapeutically. Our findings, combined with the predominantly B cell restricted expression of OCT2 and the absence of systemic phenotype in our knockout mice, suggest that an OCT2-targeted therapeutic strategy would be efficacious in both major subtypes of DLBCL whilst avoiding systemic toxicity.","Knockdown of OCT2_1196 was tested in ABC DLBCL cell lines (HBL1 n=2, OCI-Ly10 n=3, TMD8 n=2) and GCB DLBCL cell lines (BJAB n=2, HT n=2).

Tamoxifen,GSE77106,Whole-genome expression profiling of embryonic and monocyte-derived Kupffer cells,"Iron is an essential component of the erythrocyte protein hemoglobin and is crucial to oxygen transport in vertebrates. In the steady state, erythrocyte production is in equilibrium with erythrocyte removal1. In various pathophysiological conditions, erythrocyte life span is severely compromised, which threatens the organism with anemia and iron toxicity 2,3. Here we identify anon-demand mechanism specific to the liver that clears erythrocytes and recycles iron. We showthat Ly-6Chigh monocytes ingest stressed and senescent erythrocytes, accumulate in the liver, and differentiate to ferroportin 1 (FPN1)-expressing macrophages that can deliver iron to hepatocytes. Monocyte-derived FPN1+ Tim-4neg macrophages are transient, reside alongside embryonically-derived Tim-4high Kuppfer cells, and depend on Csf1 and Nrf2. The spleenlikewise recruits iron-loaded Ly-6Chigh monocytes, but they do not differentiate into ironrecycling macrophages due to the suppressive action of Csf2, and are instead shuttled to the livervia coordinated chemotactic cues. Inhibiting this mechanism by preventing monocyte recruitment to the liver leads to kidney failure and liver damage. These observations identify the liver as the primary organ supporting emergency erythrocyte removal and iron recycling, and uncover a mechanism by which the body adapts to fluctuations in erythrocyte integrity.;Pregnant CX3CR1-CreERT+/+ Stopfl/fl tdTomato mice were injected subcutaneously with tamoxifen (8 mg/animal in 400 µl corn oil s.c.) on days 13.5and 15.5 p.c to induce tdTomato expression in embryonic monocytes/macrophages.

Tamoxifen,GSE75971,Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a novel mechanism of resistance to estrogen deprivation in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer,"Therapies targeting estrogenic stimulation in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) reduce mortality, but resistance remains a major clinical problem. Molecular studies have shown few high frequency mutations to be associated with endocrine resistance. In contrast, expression profiling of primary ER+ BC samples has identified several promising signatures/networks for targeting.  In this study, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was the common upregulated pathway in the ER+ LTED but not ER- LTED cell lines, suggesting a potential mechanism dependent on continued ER expression. Targeting the individual genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with siRNAs caused a 30-50% drop in proliferation. Further analysis showed increased expression of 25-hydroxycholesterol (HC) in the MCF7 LTED cells. Exogenous 25-HC or 27-HC increased ER mediated-transcription and expression of the endogenous estrogen-regulated gene TFF1 in ER+ LTED cells but not in the ER-negative LTED. Additionally, recruitment of the ER and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the TFF1 promoter was increased upon treatment with 25-HC and 27-HC. In silico analysis of 704 primary ER+ BC patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen showed increased expression of MSMO1 (p=0.047), EBP (p=0.043), SQLE (p=0.000009), and IDI1 (p=0.0005), enzymes required for cholesterol synthesis and increased in our in vitro models of endocrine resistance, to be associated with poor relapse-free survival. In contrast, no association was identified in over 700 patients with ER-negative BC. Taken together, these data provide support for the role of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and the cholesterol metabolites, 25-HC and 27-HC, in a novel mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ BC that has potential as a therapeutic target.","To identify common adaptive mechanisms associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AI), we assessed changes in global gene expression during adaptation to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) in a panel of ER+ BC cell lines cultured in 2D on plastic (MCF7, T47D, HCC1428, SUM44 and ZR75.1) or 3D on collagen (MCF7) to model the stromal compartment. Furthermore, dimethyl labelling followed by LC-MS/MS was used to assess global changes in protein abundance.

We also show that binding of Suz12 to RNA or chromatin is mutually inhibitory. Although Ezh2 and Jarid2 also bind RNA, Ezh2 and Jarid2 deletion causes an increase in Suz12 RNA binding, without changing its specificity, which reflects the loss of Suz12 from chromatin. Similarly, disruption of Suz12-RNA interactions by RNA polymerase II inhibition or RNase treatment increases Suz12 binding to chromatin.

Tamoxifen,GSE66831,The interaction of PRC2 with RNA or chromatin is mutually antagonistic,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) modifies chromatin to maintain genes in a repressed state during development. PRC2 is primarily associated with CpG islands at repressed genes and also possesses RNA binding activity. However, the RNAs that bind PRC2 in cells, the subunits that mediate these interactions, and the role of RNA in PRC2 recruitment to chromatin all remain unclear. By performing iCLIP for PRC2 in comparison with other RNA binding proteins, we show here that PRC2 binds nascent RNA at essentially all active genes. Although interacting with RNA promiscuously, PRC2 binding is enriched at specific locations within RNAs, primarily exon-intron boundaries and the 3’UTR. Deletion of other PRC2 subunits reveals that SUZ12 is sufficient to establish this RNA binding profile. Contrary to prevailing models, we also demonstrate that the interaction of PRC2 with RNA or chromatin is mutually antagonistic in cells and in vitro. RNA degradation in cells triggers PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands at active genes. Correspondingly, release of PRC2 from chromatin in cells increases RNA binding. Consistent with this, RNA and nucleosomes compete for PRC2 binding in vitro. We propose that RNA prevents PRC2 recruitment to chromatin at active genes and that mutual antagonism between RNA and chromatin underlies the pattern of PRC2 chromatin association across the genome.","We used individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP) to identify the RNAs directly bound by endogenous PRC2 in mouse embryonic stem cells. We performed iCLIP with an antibody to SUZ12 in 6 biological replicate experiments. In order to relate PRC2 RNA binding activity to other RNA binding proteins and to control for potential biases in the methodology, we performed iCLIP for the splicing regulators FUS and HNRNPC. To control for non-specific crosslink events, we performed iCLIP for SUZ12 in Suz12-/- cells, for GFP in transfected cells and with a non-specific IgG antibody control. Since crosslink frequency is related to RNA abundance, we also performed total RNA sequencing. To determine the role of SUZ12 in PRC2 RNA binding, we also performed iCLIP for SUZ12 in cells lacking EZH2 (Ezh2 d/d) and in cells lack JARID2. RNA-seq was also performed in Ezh2 d/d cells.
