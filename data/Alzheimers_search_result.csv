Alzheimers Disease,GSE77471,Gamma oscillations attenuate amyloid pathology and trigger a protective microglia response in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Gamma oscillations (20-50Hz) are a common local field potential signature in many brain regions that are generated by a resonant circuit between fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons and pyramidal cells. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of gamma have been observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders.  However, it is unclear how disruptions in gamma oscillations affect cellular pathologies seen in these disorders. Here, we investigate this using the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and find reduced power and magnitude of behaviorally driven gamma oscillatory activity — even before the onset of plaque formation or measurable cognitive decline. Because of the early onset, we aimed to determine if exogenous manipulations of gamma could influence the progression of disease pathology. We find that driving PV-positive neurons at gamma frequency (40Hz) using channelrhodopsin-2 reduced total levels of amyloid-ß (Aß) 40 and 42 isoforms in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mouse. Driving PV-positive neurons at other frequencies, or driving excitatory neurons, did not reduce Aß levels.  Furthermore, driving PV-positive neurons reduced enlarged endosomes in hippocampal neurons and cleavage intermediates of APP in 5XFAD mouse. Gene expression profiling revealed a neuroprotective response with morphological transformation of microglia and markedly increased phagocytosis of Aß by microglia. Inspired by these observations, we designed a non-invasive light-flickering paradigm that drives 40Hz gamma activity in mouse visual cortex. The light-flickering paradigm profoundly reduced Aß40 and Aß42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-symptomatic mice and greatly mitigated plaque load in the visual cortex of aged, symptomatic mice. This reduction was completely blocked by a GABA-A antagonist, providing further support for an essential role of GABAergic signaling in mediating neuroprotective gamma activity. Overall, our findings uncover a dramatic and previously unappreciated function of the brain’s endogenous gamma rhythms in reducing the production and increasing the clearance of Aß  peptides, whose accumulation is believed to drive the pathogenesis of AD.","Two to four weeks following virus injection and implant placement, hippocampal CA1 neurons were optigenetically manipulated.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE79376,Genome-wide expression profiling of USP9X/Y knockdown in the DU145 cell culture model,"Public transcriptomics studies have shown that several genes display pronounced gender differences in their expression in the human brain, and these differences may influence the clinical manifestations and risk for neuronal disorders. While disease relevant implications have already been proposed for gender differences in hormone levels, life style and genetic diversity, a systems level analysis of brain gene expression disparities between the genders in the context of brain disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has not yet been conducted.;Here we apply a transcriptome-wide analysis to discover genes with gender-specific expression and significant alterations in public post mortem brain tissue from AD patients compared to unaffected controls. We identify the sex-linked ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 (USP9) as an outstanding candidate gene with one of the largest ratios of male to female median expression levels during adulthood and a highly significant underexpression of the Y-chromosomal form of the gene (USP9Y) in male AD patients compared to controls. Previous studies have shown that USP9 can modulate the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), whose dysregulation in AD is thought to play a key role in disease. Here, after observing a high positive correlation between USP9Y and MAPT expression in public transcriptomics data from AD case/control studies, we show that USP9 knockdown results in significantly decreased MAPT expression in the in vitro DU145 cell culture model. From the analysis of transcriptomics data for the knockdown in DU145 cells and prior knowledge from the literature, we derive a model for a USP9-dependent regulatory mechanism modulating MAPT expression via BACH1 and SMAD4. Overall, the combined transcriptomics analyses and identified functional links between USP9 and MAPT suggest USP9 may partially account for gender differences observed in tauopathies and could provide a new target for intervention strategies to modulate MAPT expression and phosphorylation.","To assess the biomolecular effects of knocking down USP9 on a transcriptome-wide scale, the human DU145 prostate cancer cell culture model was chosen, after confirming that both USP9X and USP9Y are robustly expressed in this model. ShRNA constructs were then designed for the knockdown of USP9X and USP9X/Y (i.e. targeting USP9X and USP9Y jointly) to infer potential USP9Y-specific gene alterations indirectly by comparing both knockdowns. As readout, microarray expression profiling using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 platform was performed with triplicate samples for each of five considered conditions (USP9X/Y knockdown, USP9X knockdown, scrambled RNA control, transfection reagent control, and unperturbed control).",GPL19251,15,Expression profiling by array,NA

Alzheimers Disease,GSE83722,Lipid biosynthesis coordinates a Mitochondrial to Cytosolic Stress Response,"Defects in mitochondrial metabolism have been increasingly linked with age-onset protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. In response to protein folding stress, compartment-specific unfolded protein responses (UPRs) within the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and cytosol work in parallel to ensure cellular protein homeostasis. While perturbation of individual compartments can make other compartments more susceptible to protein stress, the cellular conditions that trigger cross-communication between the individual UPRs remain poorly understood.;We have uncovered a conserved, robust mechanism linking mitochondrial protein homeostasis and the cytosolic folding environment through changes in lipid homeostasis. Metabolic restructuring caused by mitochondrial stress or small molecule activators trigger changes in gene expression coordinated uniquely by both the mitochondrial and cytosolic UPRs, protecting the cell from disease-associated proteins. Our data suggest an intricate and unique system of communication between UPRs in response to metabolic changes that could unveil new targets for diseases of protein misfolding.","Because the induction of the MCSR due to hsp-6 RNAi required both hsf-1 and dve-1, key transcription factors required for the HSR and UPRmt, respectively, we asked which gene sets are coordinately regulated by both factors.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE72782,5-Hydroxymenthylation-associated Epigenetic Modifiers in Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive function. Evidence suggests a role for epigenetic regulation, in particular the cytosine modifications 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC,) in AD. 5hmC is highly enriched in the nervous system and displays neurodevelopment and age-related changes. To determine the role of 5hmC in AD, we performed genome-wide analyses of 5hmC in DNA from prefrontal cortex of post-mortem AD as well as RNA-Seq to correlate changes in methylation status with transcriptional changes. We also utilized the existing AD fly model to further test the functional significance of these epigenetically altered loci. We identified 325 genes containing differentially hydroxymethylated loci (DhMLs) in both the discovery and replication datasets, and these are enriched for pathways involved in neuron projection development and neurogenesis. Of the 325 genes identified, 140 also showed changes in gene expression by RNA-Seq. Proteins encoded by genes identified in the current analysis form direct protein-protein interactions with AD-associated genes, expanding the network of genes implicated in AD. Furthermore, we identified AD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within or near DhMLs, suggesting that these SNPs may identify regions of epigenetic gene regulation that play a role in AD pathogenesis. Finally using the existing AD fly model we showed that some of these genes could modulate the toxicity associated with AD. Our data implicate neuron projection development and neurogenesis pathways as potential targets in AD.  These results indicate that incorporating epigenomic and transcriptomic data with GWAS data can expand the known network of genes involved in disease pathogenesis.

In this study, we developed a small RNA library from pooled RNA samples from young seedling to matured fruits and identified both conserved and pomegranate-specific miRNA from 29,948,480 high-quality reads. For the pool of 15- to 30-nt small RNAs, ~50% were 24 nt. The miR157 family was the most abundant, followed by miR156, miR160, and miR159, with many variants within each family.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE76612,Tip60 HAT action mediates environmental enrichment induced cognitive restoration,"Environmental enrichment (EE) conditions have profound beneficial effects for reinstating cognitive ability in neuropathological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD).   While EE benefits involve epigenetic gene control mechanisms that comprise histone acetylation, the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) involved remain largely unknown.  Here, we examine a role for Tip60 HAT action in mediating activity- dependent beneficial neuroadaptations to EE using the Drosophila CNS mushroom body (MB) as a well-characterized cognition model.   We show that flies raised under EE conditions display enhanced MB axonal outgrowth, synapse protein production, histone acetylation induction and transcriptional activation of cognition linked genes when compared to their genotypically identical siblings raised under isolated conditions.  Further, these beneficial changes are impaired in both Tip60 HAT mutant flies and APP neurodegenerative flies.   While EE conditions provide only slight beneficial neuroadaptive changes in the APP neurodegenerative fly MB, such positive changes are significantly enhanced by increasing MB Tip60 HAT levels.  Our results implicate Tip60 as a critical mediator of EE-induced benefits, and provide insight into synergistic behavioral and epigenetic based approaches for treatment of cognitive disorders.;EE has been shown to positively impact gene expression profiles in the mouse brain that are enriched in functions such as neuronal structure, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.  Thus, we asked whether the EE induced beneficial MB structural and synaptic changes we observe are accompanied by neuroadaptive transcriptional benefits in the Drosophila MB, and if so, is Tip60 HAT action required for this process. To address this question, we accessed EE induced beneficial transcriptional changes using microarray.","We crossed our UAS-mCD8-GFP;Tip60E431Q flies or control UAS-mCD8-GFP flies to MB GAL4 OK-107 to simultaneously induce Tip60 HAT loss in the MB while tagging MB cells with GFP.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE76567,Transcriptomic Analysis of the Hippocampus from Six Inbred Strains of Mice Suggests Basis for Sex-Specific Susceptibility and Severity of Neurological Disorders,"Identifying sex differences in gene expression within the brain is critical for determining why multiple neurological and behavioral disorders differentially affect males and females. Several are more common or severe in males (e.g., autism and schizophrenia) or females (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and depression). We analyzed transcriptomic data from the mouse hippocampus of six inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, DBA/2J and PWD/Ph), to provide a perspective on differences between male and female gene expression. Our data show that: 1) significant gene expression differences in males versus females varies substantially across the strains, 2) 12 genes exist that are differentially expressed across the inbred strains (termed core genes), and 3) there are >2,600 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the strains (termed non-core genes). We found that DBA/2J uniquely has a substantial majority (89%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in females than males; 129/SvImJ is the most strongly male-biased with a majority (69%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in males. To gain insight into the sex-biased DEGs, we examined gene ontology, pathway and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment in phenotypes related to abnormal nervous system morphology and physiology, among others. In addition, several pathways are enriched significantly, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with 32 genes implicated in AD, 8 of which are male-biased. Three of the male-biased genes have been implicated in a neuroprotective role in AD. Our transcriptomic data provide new insight into understanding the possible genetic bases for sex-specific susceptibility and severity of brain disorders.",Hippocampal mRNA from adult males and females of six inbred strains of mice were analyzed by RNA sequencing of 3 biological replicates using an Illumina HiSeq 2500,GPL17021,36,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,NA
Alzheimers Disease,GSE66598,The choroid plexus transcriptome reveals changes in type I and II interferon responses in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a marked decline in cognition and memory formation. Increasing evidence highlights the essential role of neuroinflammatory and immune-related molecules, namely the ones that are produced at the brain barriers, on brain immune surveillance, cellular dysfunction and amyloid beta (Aß) pathology in AD. Therefore, understanding the response at the brain barriers may unravel novel pathways that are relevant for the pathophysiology of AD. Herein, we focused on the study of the choroid plexus (CP), which constitutes the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, in aging and in AD. Specifically, we used the PDGFB-APPSwInd (J20) transgenic mouse model of AD, which presents early memory decline and progressive Aß accumulation, and littermate age-matched wild-type (WT) mice, to characterize the CP transcriptome at 3, 5-6 and 11-12 months of age. The most striking observation was that the CP of J20 mice displayed an overall overexpression of type I interferon (IFN) response genes at all ages. Moreover, J20 mice presented a high expression of type II IFN genes in the CP at 3 months, which became lower than WT at 5-6 and 11-12 months. Importantly, along with a marked memory impairment and increased glial activation, J20 mice also presented a similar overexpression of type I IFN genes in the dorsal hippocampus at 3 months. Altogether, these findings provide new insights on a possible interplay between type I and type II IFN responses in AD and point to IFNs as mediators of cognitive decline in aging and in AD.","The CP transcriptome of at least 3 mice of each age (3, 5-6 and 11-12 months) and of each genotype (WT or J20) was analyzed and compared.",GPL6885,24,Expression profiling by array,NA

We have generated two hiPSC clones from a non-familial Alzheimer’s patient (AD-iPSCs), which expressed typical undifferentiated markers and fulfilled standard pluripotency assays. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that AD-iPSCs are highly similar to control hiPSCs and hESCs, albeit with some noticeable differences in several genes: DNAJC15, GRPR, NAIP and SNORD116-18. Several other biomarkers were differentially expressed in AD-iPSC clones, which were implicated in memory impairment and AD. Furthermore, well characterized familial AD-associated genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) and non-familial (A2M, APOE, GAP43, MAOA, MPO, PLAT, PLAU, SORL1, SNCA) exhibited different expression patterns but were largely reset upon reprogramming into a pluripotent state. Overall, hiPSCs can be good candidates for AD modeling and may represent an in vitro alternative to studying disease mechanisms and drug discovery/toxicology studies.","Fibroblasts and two hiPSC clones from a non-familial Alzheimer’s patient (AD-iPSCs) were analyzed.

The goal of this study was the identification of a novel mode of action for this unmet need. Pharmacological tool compounds: suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and tadalafil, targeting histone deacetylases (HDAC) and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) respectively, were utilized simultaneously for in-vitro and in-vivo Proof-of-Concept (PoC). A synergistic effect was observed in the amelioration of AD signs using the combination therapy in Tg2576 mice. Finally, a therapeutic agent, CM-414, inhibiting simultaneously HDAC2/6 and PDE5 was generated and tested in Tg2576 mice.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE75047,Enhanced Phospholipase A2 group 3 expression by oxidative stress decreases the insulin-degrading enzyme,"Oxidative stress has a ubiquitous role in neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative damage in  specific regions of the brain is associated with selective neurodegeneration. We previously reported that Alzheimer disease (AD) model mice showed decreased insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) levels in the cerebrum and accelerated phenotypic features of AD when crossbred with alpha-tocopherol transfer protein knockout (Ttpa-/-) mice. To further investigate the role of chronic oxidative stress in AD pathophysiology, we performed DNA microarray analysis using young and aged wild-type mice and aged Ttpa-/- mice. Among the genes whose expression changed dramatically was Phospholipase A2 group 3 (Pla2g3); Pla2g3 was identified because of its expression profile of cerebral specific up-regulation by chronic oxidative stress in silico and in aged Ttpa-/- mice. Immunohistochemical studies also demonstrated that human astrocytic Pla2g3 expression was significantly increased in human AD brains compared with control brains. Moreover, transfection of HEK293 cells with human Pla2g3 decreased endogenous IDE expression in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show a key role of Pla2g3 on the reduction of IDE, and suggest that cerebrum specific increase of Pla2g3 is involved in the initiation and/or progression of AD.","Gene expression in cerebral cortex and cerebellum of mice were determined using Agilent chips.

Yet, not much is known about the molecular alterations underlying this reactive phenotype. To get an insight into the molecular changes underlying AD induced astrocyte and microglia reactivity, we performed a transcriptional analysis on acutely isolated astrocytes and microglia from the cortex of aged controls and APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice. As expected, both cell types acquired a proinflammatory phenotype, which confirms the validity of our approach. Interestingly, we observed that the immune alteration in astrocytes was relatively more pronounced than in microglia. Concurrently, our data reveal that astrocytes display a reduced expression of neuronal support genes and genes involved in neuronal communication. The microglia showed a reduced expression of phagocytosis and/or endocytosis genes. Co-expression analysis of a human AD expression data set and the astrocyte and microglia data sets revealed that the inflammatory changes in astrocytes were remarkably comparable in mouse and human AD, whereas the microglia changes showed less similarity. Based on these findings we argue that chronically proinflammatory astrocyte and microglia phenotypes, showing a reduction of genes involved in neuronal support and neuronal signaling, are likely to contribute to the neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD.","2 cell types from 2 conditions: cortical microglia and cortical astrocytes from 15-18 month old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared to wildtype littermates.

The functional consequences of this upregulation are unclear. To identify molecular pathways coupled to IF regulation in reactive astrocytes, and to study the interaction with microglia, we examined WT and APPswe/PS1dE9 (AD) mice lacking either GFAP, or both VIM and GFAP, and determined the transcriptome of cortical astrocytes and microglia from 15- to 18-month-old mice. Genes involved in lysosomal degradation (including several cathepsins) and in inflammatory response (including Cxcl5, Tlr6, Tnf, Il1b) exhibited a higher AD-induced increase when GFAP, or VIM and GFAP, were absent. The expression of Aqp4 and Gja1 displayed the same pattern. The downregulation of neuronal support genes in astrocytes from AD mice was absent in GFAP/VIM null mice. In contrast, the absence of IFs did not affect the transcriptional alterations induced by AD in microglia, nor was the cortical plaque load altered. Visualizing astrocyte morphology in GFAP-eGFP mice showed no clear structural differences in GFAP/VIM null mice, but did show diminished interaction of astrocyte processes with plaques. Microglial proliferation increased similarly in all AD groups. In conclusion, absence of GFAP, or both GFAP and VIM, alters AD-induced changes in gene expression profile of astrocytes, showing a compensation of the decrease of neuronal support genes and a trend for a slightly higher inflammatory expression profile. However, this has no consequences for the development of plaque load, microglial proliferation, or microglial activation.","2 cell types from 6 conditions: cortical microglia and cortical astrocytes from 15-18 month old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared to wildtype littermates.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE74486,Trans-effects of chromosome aneuploidies on DNA methylation patterns:  DNA methylation analysis of Down syndrome in human brain tissues and cells,"Background: Trisomy 21 causes Down syndrome (DS), but the mechanisms by which the extra chromosome leads to deficient intellectual and immune function are not well understood.  Results: Here, we profile CpG methylation in DS and control cerebral and cerebellar cortex of adults and cerebrum of fetuses. We purify neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei and T-lymphocytes and find biologically relevant genes with DS-specific methylation (DS-DM) in brain cells. Some genes show brain-specific DS-DM, while others show stronger DS-DM in T cells. Both 5-methyl-cytosine and 5-hydroxy-methyl-cytosine contribute to the DS-DM. Thirty percent of genes with DS-DM in adult brain cells also show DS-DM in fetal brains, indicating early onset of these epigenetic changes, and we find early maturation of methylation patterns in DS brain and lymphocytes. Some, but not all, of the DS-DM genes show differential expression. DS-DM preferentially affected CpGs in or near specific transcription factor binding sites, implicating a mechanism involving altered transcription factor binding. Methyl-seq of brain DNA from mouse models with sub-chromosomal duplications mimicking DS reveals partial but significant overlaps with human DS-DM and shows that multiple chromosome 21 genes contribute to the downstream epigenetic effects.  Conclusions: These data point to novel biological mechanisms in DS and have general implications for trans effects of chromosomal duplications and aneuploidies on epigenetic patterning.","Bisulfite converted DNA from 119 samples from Down syndrome patients and controls  were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.

These chemical-induced neuronal cells (hciN cells) resembled hES-derived neurons regarding morphology, gene expression profiles, and electrophysiological properties.

Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan; however, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible CR benefits remain unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration throughout aging. Thus, we examined the influence of long-term CR on the CA1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses an age-dependent signature of 882 genes functionally associated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA1 region transcriptional profiles at younger- (5 months) and older-adult (15 months) timepoints, we identify conserved upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa proteins 1b and 5 (Hspa1b and Hspa5), protein disulfide isomerase family A members 4 and 6 (Pdia4 and Pdia6), and calreticulin (Calr).

Alzheimers Disease,GSE70475,TREM2 regulates microglial cell activation in response to demyelination in vivo,"Microglia are phagocytic cells that survey the brain and perform neuroprotective functions in response to tissue damage, but their activating receptors are largely unknown. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial immunoreceptor whose loss-of-function mutations in humans cause presenile dementia, while genetic variants are associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. In myeloid cells, TREM2 has been involved in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory responses in vitro. However, it is unknown how TREM2 contributes to microglia function in vivo. Here, we identify a critical role for TREM2 in the activation and function of microglia during cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination. TREM2-deficient (TREM2(-/-)) mice had defective clearance of myelin debris and more axonal pathology, resulting in impaired clinical performances compared to wild-type (WT) mice. TREM2(-/-) microglia proliferated less in areas of demyelination and were less activated, displaying a more resting morphology and decreased expression of the activation markers MHC II and inducible nitric oxide synthase as compared to WT. Mechanistically, gene expression and ultrastructural analysis of microglia suggested a defect in myelin degradation and phagosome processing during CPZ intoxication in TREM2(-/-) microglia.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE64855,Peturbation of PICALM Levels Alters Cellular Cholesterol Metabolism,"PICALM (Phosphatidyl Inositol Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid protein) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. PICALM also affects the internalization of SNAREs and modulates macroautophagy. Chromosomal translocations that result in the fusion of PICALM to heterologous proteins cause leukemias, and genome-wide association studies have linked Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of PICALM to Alzheimer’s disease.;To obtain insight into the biological role of PICALM, we performed gene expression studies of PICALM-deficient and PICALM-expressing cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated that PICALM expression influences the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipoprotein uptake. GC-MS studies indicated that loss of PICALM increases total cholesterol pool size. Isotopic labeling studies revealed that loss of PICALM alters cholesterol homeostasis via increased scavenging of cholesterol. Measurement of LDL receptor endocytosis further showed that PICALM deficient cells express higher LDLR levels resulting in higher lipoprotein internalization. These findings suggest that PICALM is required for cellular cholesterol homeostasis and point to a novel mechanism by which PICALM alterations may contribute to disease.","Total RNA was isolated (Qiagen RNeasy® Micro kit, Valencia, CA) from four replicates of PICALM knockout cells transfected with control vector, and from four replicates of PICALM knockout cells transfected with PICALM.",GPL8321,8,Expression profiling by array,26075887

The ability to identify early markers in blood, which appear before the onset of clinical symptoms is of considerable interest to allow early intervention, particularly in “high risk” groups such as those with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Here we present longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation data comparing 18 elderly individuals with T2D who developed pre-symptomatic dementia within an 18 month period following baseline assessment to 18 age, sex and education matched controls who maintained normal cognitive function. We identified a highly significant overlap in the effect size of the top-ranked methylation sites at baseline and follow-up, and identified 10 robust loci, some of which have been previously related to neurodegenerative processes, which were consistently differentially methylated prior to symptoms at baseline, and at 18 month follow up, when a diagnosis of pre-symptomatic dementia had been provided. Finally we show a significant overlap in the effect size of the top-ranked methylation sites in converters, only after they develop symptoms of pre-symptomatic dementia, with changes at the same loci in blood samples from patients with clinically-diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease.","18 elderly individuals with T2D who developed pre-symptomatic dementia within 18 months following baseline assessment and 18 age, sex and education matched controls who maintained normal cognitive function",GPL13534,70,Methylation profiling by genome tiling array,NA

Alzheimers Disease,GSE57181,In vivo response of microglia to Aß and prostaglandin-E2 EP2 receptor signaling,"Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, perform critical inflammatory and non-inflammatory functions to maintain homeostasis and normal neural function.  However in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), these beneficial functions become progressively impaired, contributing to synapse and neuron loss and cognitive impairment. The inflammatory cyclooxygenase-PGE2 pathway, including the PGE2 receptor EP2, is implicated in AD development, both in human epidemiology and in transgenic models of AD.;To test the transcriptional responses of EP2-deficient microglia to Aß in vivo, we used mice in which the EP2 receptor is conditionally deleted in microglia using the CD11b-Cre transgene and floxed alleles of the EP2 gene. By injecting these mice with Aß ICV and isolating microglia from the brains, we have been able to establish the transcriptional response of microglia to Aß in vivo and test how EP2 deletion in microglia affects this response.","8 month-old C57BL/6 mice, of the genotype CD11b-Cre; EP2+/+ or CD11b-Cre; EP2lox/lox, were injected I.C.V. with either Aß or vehicle. 48 hours after injection, the mice were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with cold heparinized 0.9% NaCl. Brains were then removed from the mice and pooled, two brains of the same genotype per sample, to ensure adequate cell and RNA yield.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE65159,Conserved epigenomic signatures between mouse and human elucidate immune basis of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe1 age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aß) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, and cognitive decline.  Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized.  Here, we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration.  We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1.  Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), while decreasing-level enhancer orthologs show fetal brain specific enhancer activity.  Surprisingly, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologs implicating immune processes in AD predisposition.  Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE55173,A Human Model of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Using Neural Crest-Derived Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells,"There is a growing recognition of cerebrovascular contribution to neurodegenerative diseases. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterised by amyloid-beta (Aß) deposits in the walls of intracerebral and leptomeningeal arteries, is evident in a majority of Alzheimer’s disease patients and aged people. Here, we leverage on human pluripotent stem cells to generate vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from neural crest progenitors, recapitulating brain vasculature-specific attributes in Aß metabolism. We confirm that the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1, functions in our neural crest-derived SMCs to mediate Aß uptake and intracellular proteasomal degradation. Hypoxia significantly compromises the ability of SMCs in Aß clearance by suppressing LRP1 expression. This enables us to develop an assay of Aß uptake using the neural crest-derived SMCs with hypoxia as a stress paradigm. We then tested several vascular protective compounds in a high throughput format, demonstrating the value of stem cell-based phenotypic screening for novel CAA therapeutics and drug repurposing.","We adopted our previous SMC differentiation protocol (Cheung et al., 2012) to differentiate this intermediate neural crest population using platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB, 10 ng/ml) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-ß1, 2ng/ml) for another 12 days.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE39420,Gene expression profile of sporadic and PSEN1 early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia. Around 10% of cases present an age of onset before 65 years-old, which in turn can be divided in monogenic or familial AD (FAD) and sporadic early-onset AD (EOAD). Mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP genes have been linked with FAD. The aim of our study was to describe the brain whole-genome RNA expression profile of the posterior cingulate area in EOAD and FAD caused by PSEN1 mutations (FAD-PSEN1). 14 patients (7 EOAD and 7 FAD-PSEN1) and 7 neurologically healthy controls were selected and samples were hybridized in a Human Gene 1.1 microarray from Affymetrix. When comparing controls with EOAD and controls with FAD-PSEN1, we found 3183 and 3351 differentially expressed genes (DEG) respectively (FDR corrected p<0.05). However, any DEG was found in the comparison of the two groups of patients. Microarrays were validated through quantitative-PCR of 17 DEG. In silico analysis of the DEG revealed an alteration in biological pathways related to calcium-signaling, axon guidance and long-term potentiation (LTP), among others, in both groups of patients. These pathways are mainly related with cell signalling cascades, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes. In conclusion, the altered biological final pathways in EOAD and FAD-PSEN1 are highly coincident. Also, the findings are in line with those previously reported for late-onset AD (LOAD, onset >65 years-old), which implies that the consequences of the disease at the molecular level are similar in the final stages of the disease.","21 Samples were analyzed: 7 controls, 7 Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 7 early-onset AD genetically determined by a mutation in PSEN1 gene.",GPL11532,21,Expression profiling by array,23369545
Alzheimers Disease,GSE46221,Increase in membrane cholesterol of neurons in culture recapitulates Alzheimer’s disease early phenotypes.,"Levels of membrane-associated cholesterol were shown to be increased in the brain of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and correlated with the severity of the disease. We previously found that heavy membrane cholesterol burden promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and processing, leading to increased amyloid-<U+F062><U+F020><U+F028>A<U+F062>) secretion. We hypothesized that such an increase of cholesterol could trigger sporadic AD. We thus acutely loaded the plasma membrane of neurons in culture with cholesterol to reach the 30 % increase observed in AD brains. We showed by multiplex electro-chemiluminescence immuno-assay that transient membrane cholesterol loading produced a significant increase of A<U+F062>42 secretion. We also found that early endosomes were enlarged and more prone to aggregation using confocal and electron microscopy and that APP vesicular transport in neuronal processes was slowed down using fluorescence live-imaging. In addition, treatment of neurons with cholesterol induced changes in gene expression profile that are reminiscent of early AD. This model of membrane cholesterol increase in cultured neurons reproduces most of early AD changes and could thus be relevant for deciphering early mechanisms and design new targets for sporadic AD.","In this study, we loaded the plasma membrane of neurons with 30% more cholesterol and observed the effects on gene expression.

Further, through a whole-genome ChIP-chip analysis we identify genes controlled by p53 in postmitotic neurons. We genetically validate a specific pathway, synaptic function, in p53-mediated neuroprotection. We then demonstrate that the control of synaptic genes by p53 is conserved in mammals.

Alzheimers Disease,GSE60911,Increased Human like Alzheimer features in a Novel Mouse Model with Oxidative DNA Repair Dysfunction,"The decline of cognitive function is a feature of normal human aging and is exacerbated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  DNA repair declines in brain cells during normal aging and even more so in AD.   Here we show that experimental reduction in levels of the base excision repair enzyme, DNA polymerase ß (Polb) renders neurons vulnerable to age-related dysfunction and degeneration in a mouse model of AD.    Whereas 3xTgAD mice exhibit age-related extracellular amyloid b-peptide (Ab) accumulation and cognitive deficits, but no neuronal death, 3xTg/Polb+/- mice accumulates intracellular Ab and neurons die in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.  The DNA repair-deficient 3xTgAD mice exhibited increased DNA strand breaks and apoptotic caspase activation with loss of hippocampal volume, and impaired synaptic plasticity and memory retention.  Molecular profiling revealed remarkable similarities in gene expression alterations in brain cells of AD patients and 3xTgAD/Polb+/- mice including multiple abnormalities suggestive of impaired cellular bioenergetics.  Our findings demonstrate that a modest decrement in oxidative DNA damage processing is sufficient to render neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathogenic molecular and cellular alterations that result in the dysfunction and death of neurons, and associated cognitive deficits.","4 mouse strains were used in these experiments,  the 3xTgAD and Pol ß (+/-) mice were bred at the National Institute on Aging (Baltimore, Maryland). The original line 3xTgAD line was generated as described previously (Oddo, et. al 2003) and possess APPswe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L mutations. DNA polymerase beta heterozygous mice, Pol ß (+/-), were crossed with the 3xTgAD mice to generate a 3xTgAD/Pol ß (+/-) mouse. The Wt strain is C57Bl/6.
