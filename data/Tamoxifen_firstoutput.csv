Site directed mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Lightning kit from Agilent. shRNAs targeting OCT2 or OCA-B were designed and cloned as double stranded oligonucleotides into a retroviral vector (pRSMX_PuroGFP) for doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression. RNAi sequences used are as follows: OCT2 shRNA#1_1196 5'-GCACAACAGTTACTACCTTAT-3', OCT2 shRNA#2_3410 5'-GGATGCTTCTTTCTCTTCACA-3', OCA-B shRNA_3017 5'-CAGCCAGAAGTACCATTAGG-3'. Because OCT2 shRNA#1 targeted the coding region of OCT2, silent mutations were introduced into the recognition site to allow the shRNA to be rescued by OCT2 constructs. Vectors: The pRSMX-PG vector coexpressing GFP and shRNA was introduced into cells and where required selection was carried out with puromycin.
